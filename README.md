# local-motion-scripts

We're working on a project called (Local Motion)[https://github.com/local-motion]. This repository
contains scripts that are useful when setting up my local environment for that project.

You can run the initial setup. It'll show you the changes that will be made, and ask for 
confirmation.
```bash
./gh_local_motion.sh setup
```

The script alters your `$HOME/.zshrc` to work with (Local Motion)[https://github.com/local-motion] by default.
